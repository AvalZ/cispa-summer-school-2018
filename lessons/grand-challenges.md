# Grand challenges in cyber security

**2000**: Business Internet

Business-to-business and business-to-client.

**2015**: User-Centric Internet

Vastly increased attack surface

**Breakthroughs in IT drive IT-security.**

**We lack foundation**

We are the only science that considers an *attacker*.
It becomes an arms race.

# Trustworthy Security Guarantees

We are in the **art** domain.
We still haven't understood how it works, we're just eyeballing countermeasures
against known attacks.

**Arms race**.

* Prove that something works on small scale
* Automate on small scale
* Prove once-and-for-all that small equals big

# Autonomous security

Actions have some consequences over reality.

## Perception

Systems look at reality and try to match to known situations.
This is also difficult without an attacker.

New situations are the most problematics.

Another problem is misinterpretation throgh manipulation.

## Connectivity and Real Time


## Privacy
